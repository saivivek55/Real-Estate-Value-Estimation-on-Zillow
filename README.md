## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 📊 Data Exploration & Manipulation
- Explored data distributions, missing values, outliers, and temporal patterns
- Performed transformations and feature selection to improve model inputs

### 🧾 SQL Integration
- Loaded dataset into MySQL and executed queries to extract regional and location-specific sales trends

### 🤖 Regression Modeling
- Trained and evaluated multiple models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to estimate property values  
- Tuned model parameters and validated performance on unseen test data  
- Evaluated predictions using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- **Best RMSE achieved:** 0.14

### 📈 Tableau Dashboard
- Uploaded processed dataset to Tableau  
- Created dashboards to visualize pricing trends over time and geography
